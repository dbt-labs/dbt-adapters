## dbt-bigquery 1.10.0-a1 - February 05, 2025

### Features

- Allow copy_partitions in microbatch ([#1414](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/issues/1414))

### Fixes

- Fix issue where dbt-bigquery was not retrying in certain retryable scenarios, e.g. 503's ([#682](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/issues/682))
- Cast `event_time` to a timestamp prior to comparing against microbatch start/end time ([#1422](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/issues/1422))
- Fix issue where rate limit errors on table service calls are not retried ([#1423](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/issues/1423))
- Fix retry scenarios so that dbt always retries when BigQuery recommends a retry ([#263](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/issues/263))

### Under the Hood

- Move from setup.py to pyproject.toml and to hatch as a dev tool ([#1407](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/issues/1407))
