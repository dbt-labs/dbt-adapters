    """
    Represents the user configuration required to describe a catalog integration

    This class serves as a blueprint for catalog integration configurations,
    providing details about the catalog type, name, and other optional
    properties necessary for integration. It is designed to be used with
    any implementation that requires a catalog configuration protocol,
    ensuring a standardized structure and attributes are in place.

    Attributes:
        name (str): the name of the catalog integration in the dbt project, e.g. "my_iceberg_operational_data"
            - a unique name for this catalog integration to be referenced in a model configuration
        catalog_type (str): the type of the catalog integration in the data platform, e.g. "iceberg_rest"
            - this is required for dbt to determine the correct method for parsing user configuration
            - usually a combination of the catalog and the way in which the data platform interacts with it
        catalog_name (Optional[str]): the name of the catalog integration in the data platform, e.g. "my_favorite_iceberg_catalog"
            - this is required for dbt to correctly reference catalogs by name from model configuration
            - expected to be unique within the data platform, but many dbt catalog integrations can share the same catalog name
        table_format (Optional[str]): the table format this catalog uses
            - this is commonly unique to each catalog type, and should only be required from the user for catalogs that support multiple formats
        external_volume (Optional[str]): external storage volume identifier
            - while this is a separate concept from catalogs, we feel it is more user-friendly to group it with the catalog configuration
            - it's possible to use a default external volume at the user, database, or account level, hence this is optional
            - a result of this grouping is that there can only be one external volume per catalog integration, but many catalogs can share the same volume
            - a user should create a new dbt catalog if they want to use a different external volume for a given catalog integration
        adapter_properties (Optional[Dict[str, Any]]):
            - additional, adapter-specific properties are nested here to avoid future collision when expanding the catalog integration protocol
