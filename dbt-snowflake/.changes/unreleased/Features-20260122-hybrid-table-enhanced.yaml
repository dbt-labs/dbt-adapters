  Add hybrid table materialization for Snowflake unistore workloads.

  Hybrid tables combine transactional (OLTP) and analytical (OLAP) processing
  with row-based storage, enforced constraints, and low-latency operations.

  Features:
  - PRIMARY KEY constraint (required)
  - UNIQUE constraints
  - FOREIGN KEY constraints
  - Secondary indexes with INCLUDE columns
  - DEFAULT values in column definitions
  - Table COMMENT support
  - Incremental MERGE operations
  - merge_exclude_columns and merge_update_columns
  - Automatic migration from standard tables via drop/recreate
