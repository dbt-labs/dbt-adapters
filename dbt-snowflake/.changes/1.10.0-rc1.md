## dbt-snowflake 1.10.0-rc1 - May 28, 2025

### Fixes

- Set append=True as default query comment append behaviour ([#1066](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/issues/1066))
- Apply cluster keys via a separate ALTER statement after creating a table via a CTAS statement. ([#1071](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/issues/1071))
- Respect QUOTED_IDENTIFIERS_IGNORE_CASE with dynamic tables. ([#993](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/issues/993))

### Under the Hood

- Remove enable_iceberg_materializations behavior flag now that 2025_01 is required ([#1025](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/issues/1025))
- Expand snapshot testing. ([#1068](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/issues/1068))
- Raise the dbt-adapters pin to 1.14.3 to make dbt-adapter dependency resolution more reliable for higher versions of snowflake. ([#1098](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-adapters/issues/1098))
