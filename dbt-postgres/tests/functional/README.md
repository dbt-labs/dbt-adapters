# This is where we are putting the pytest conversions of test/integration

#  Goals of moving tests to pytest
 * Readability
 * Modularity
 * Easier to create and debug
 * Ability to create a project for external debugging

# TODO
 * Create the ability to export a project
 * Explore using:
   *  https://github.com/pytest-docker-compose/pytest-docker-compose or
   *  https://github.com/avast/pytest-docker for automatically managing a postgres instance running in a docker container
 * Track test coverage (https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest)
