## dbt-adapters 1.3.3 - July 09, 2024

### Fixes

* Fix scenario where using the `--empty` flag causes metadata queries to contain limit clauses
* Cross-database `date` macro

### Fixes

* Update Clone test to reflect core change removing `deferred` attribute from nodes

### Under the Hood

* --limit flag no longer subshells the query. This resolves the dbt Cloud experience issue where limit prevents ordering elements..
