# **what?**
# Checks that a file has been committed under the /.changes directory
# as a new CHANGELOG entry.  Cannot check for a specific filename as
# it is dynamically generated by change type and timestamp.
# This workflow runs on pull_request_target because it requires
# secrets to post comments.

# **why?**
# Ensure code change gets reflected in the CHANGELOG.

# **when?**
# This will run for all PRs going into main.  It will
# run when they are opened, reopened, when any label is added or removed
# and when new code is pushed to the branch.  The action will get
# skipped if the 'Skip Changelog' label is present is any of the labels.
