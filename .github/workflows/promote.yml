# **what?**
# When a PR is merged, if it has the promote label, it will create
# a new PR to promote those changes to the given branch. If it can't
# cleanly do a promotion, it will comment on the merged PR of the failure.
#
# Label naming convention: "promote <branch name to promote to>"
# Example: promote stable
#
# You MUST "Squash and merge" the original PR or this won't work.

# **why?**
# Changes sometimes need to be promoted from main to release branches.
# This automates the promotion process

# **when?**
# Once a PR is "Squash and merge"'d, by adding a promote label, this is triggered
